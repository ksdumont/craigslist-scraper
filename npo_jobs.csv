Orthogenesys (www.orthogenesys.com) is an early-stage, direct-to-consumer technology company that specializes in preventive and rehabilitation products and services. We create products designed to provide effective and individualized exercise solutions for consumers over age 55 looking to regain, recover or improve their current state of musculoskeletal and/or cardiovascular health. Our Fit Cycles share a unifying hardware platform but use different and highly specialized software solutions tailored to the physical health needs of each of the markets they have been developed for. 

Every Fit Cycle is a unique integration of patented hardware that incorporates bluetooth enabled sensors, which measure progress throughout the rehab process, and artificial-intelligence-powered coaching software that guides the user through personalized exercise protocols. The A.I. in our device is designed to be fun, interactive and motivational. It gives ongoing encouragement and feedback, and brings the addictive nature of digital games into the user experience to stimulate a high level of compliance. The exercises and game-based features programmed into the Fit Cycle apply gamification techniques to enhance and optimize the pain-recovery and/or physical-health goals of our consumer base. 

We are currently looking for a remote Gamification Specialist who is well-versed in game design patterns, principles, models and methods, and who can apply their expertise in gamification and behavior design to the unique products we have developed. 

Roles & Responsibilities

We are specifically looking for a candidate who can conceptualize our user experience through implementing and integrating the mechanisms and techniques of gamification into the software and hardware of our product. Ideally, you will have seasoned experience as a game designer, and you have a working knowledge of game design elements when successfully applied in consumer-based technologies/products. You have hands-on experience in the digital space with: leaderboards, badges, enduring play, puzzles, game show-like enhancements, clear goals, different game styles, personas, etc.

It is most important that you know how to “think”/visual/build games through, and that you have direct and applied knowledge of the motivational mechanisms underlying gamification-oriented products that drive user/consumer-engagement. Understanding how to execute and improve upon the techniques of gamification as they relate to chaining certain behaviors and/or habits between our consumer-base and the Fit Cycles they are interacting with is a core requirement of this position.

Examples of game design proficiency we are looking for can be seen in Wii Fit, PlankPad, StealthCore Trainer, Vi Personal Trainer, VZFit, FitBit, CandyCrush, DuoLingo, etc.

Requirements: 

- 5+ years of experience with gamification or behavioral design in the digital space, or as a game designer
- A portfolio of games or gamification work done with you as a primary contributor; preference will be given to candidates who have applied gamification techniques to adults 55+
- Working knowledge of multiple technology platforms, softwares, systems, and brands
- Experience with ehealth, exogaming, self-improvement and/or consumer-driven health apps and softwares, a plus
- Available to scale hours, starting at about 5-15 hours per week with potential to become full-time for the right fit  

Now a little bit about me: my name is Michael Bissonnette I am a serial entrepreneur who has founded and grown my last two companies into international public companies, including my most recent local company AeroGrow International. Please review my background at www.directpublicfunding.com

Currently out of retirement, I have helped a high-tech medical rehab company raise $30 million and bring an extraordinary new product to the market (see romtech.com for details). I am also the president of RomTech.

As a seasoned marketer, I saw the huge potential of using this same technology to develop a lower cost product with more customized features tailored for the consumer market.

As a spin off from RomTech, I founded OrthoGenesys and filed 6 patents on 2 revolutionary new consumer rehab/medical products. We have built prototypes and are currently working on manufacturing and a go-to-market strategy. 

For the right candidate, this is a long-term position with tremendous growth potential.  Compensation is competitive and is based on experience, accomplishments, and proven success.  

Qualified candidates, please respond and include:

- A cover letter detailing why you are the ideal fit for this job and your current pay requirements
- An up-to-date resume
- A few examples of products you have worked on

Finally, openness, honesty, and candidness are qualities we respond to—as opposed to framing things in the right way with the right words. Please be who you are and let the dice roll.

We offer a place to explore your potential, stretch your goals and push out the edges of what can be. We look for people who can think, be challenged, learn and grow. 

We see a Senior Data / Cloud Engineer to join a new team. 

Two new teams are being formed to manipulate large volumes of data. Previous data engineering experience in Cloud settings will give you a foundation for success.  Successful candidates can come from any background, but ideally will have a good mix of the following:

•	Ability to design, develop, configure, and implement complex solutions and code in Python and/or PySpark

•	Experience in cloud infrastructure (AWS preferred: S3, EC2, RDS, EMR, etc.)

•	Ability to design, develop, configure, test, and implement complex solutions and code in containerized environments, such as Docker

•	Experience working with CI/CD tools such as Jenkins

•	Attitude and aptitude for learning and applying new technologies


The work

•	Lots of backend, data engineering work (ETL, transformation, taking data from one database, manipulating it, and moving it to another target, most likely RDS, MySQL and possibly some Teradata or SAP). Lots of small micro services. We’ll be working on the “glue” between big data systems.
•	Technologies that would be most helpful to hit the ground running would include Python and/or PySpark, CI/CD with Jenkins, containers (Docker/ECS/Fargate) and strong SQL as we’ll likely be writing a fair amount of SQL queries. Should know S3 inside and out and we strongly prefer good familiarity with RDS.
•	Nice-to-have technologies (we haven’t decided if we’re using these yet) would include EMR, Kafka, serverless Lambdas and Snowflake.
•	Note – since this project is still evolving, please have a good amount of flexibility. We also prefer engineers with different perspectives who aren’t shy about bringing new ideas to the table.

Orthogenesys (www.orthogenesys.com) is an early-stage, direct-to-consumer technology company that specializes in preventive and rehabilitation products and services. We create products designed to provide effective and individualized exercise solutions for consumers over age 55 looking to regain, recover or improve their current state of musculoskeletal and/or cardiovascular health. Our Fit Cycles share a unifying hardware platform but use different and highly specialized software solutions tailored to the physical health needs of each of the markets they have been developed for. 

Every Fit Cycle is a unique integration of patented hardware that incorporates bluetooth enabled sensors, which measure progress throughout the rehab process, and artificial-intelligence-powered coaching software that guides the user through personalized exercise protocols. The A.I. in our device is designed to be fun, interactive and motivational. It gives ongoing encouragement and feedback, and brings the addictive nature of digital games into the user experience to stimulate a high level of compliance. The exercises and game-based features programmed into the Fit Cycle apply gamification techniques to enhance and optimize the pain-recovery and/or physical-health goals of our consumer base. 

We are currently looking for a remote Gamification Specialist who is well-versed in game design patterns, principles, models and methods, and who can apply their expertise in gamification and behavior design to the unique products we have developed. 

Roles & Responsibilities

We are specifically looking for a candidate who can conceptualize our user experience through implementing and integrating the mechanisms and techniques of gamification into the software and hardware of our product. Ideally, you will have seasoned experience as a game designer, and you have a working knowledge of game design elements when successfully applied in consumer-based technologies/products. You have hands-on experience in the digital space with: leaderboards, badges, enduring play, puzzles, game show-like enhancements, clear goals, different game styles, personas, etc.

It is most important that you know how to “think”/visual/build games through, and that you have direct and applied knowledge of the motivational mechanisms underlying gamification-oriented products that drive user/consumer-engagement. Understanding how to execute and improve upon the techniques of gamification as they relate to chaining certain behaviors and/or habits between our consumer-base and the Fit Cycles they are interacting with is a core requirement of this position.

Examples of game design proficiency we are looking for can be seen in Wii Fit, PlankPad, StealthCore Trainer, Vi Personal Trainer, VZFit, FitBit, CandyCrush, DuoLingo, etc.

Requirements: 

- 5+ years of experience with gamification or behavioral design in the digital space, or as a game designer
- A portfolio of games or gamification work done with you as a primary contributor; preference will be given to candidates who have applied gamification techniques to adults 55+
- Working knowledge of multiple technology platforms, softwares, systems, and brands
- Experience with ehealth, exogaming, self-improvement and/or consumer-driven health apps and softwares, a plus
- Available to scale hours, starting at about 5-15 hours per week with potential to become full-time for the right fit  

Now a little bit about me: my name is Michael Bissonnette I am a serial entrepreneur who has founded and grown my last two companies into international public companies, including my most recent local company AeroGrow International. Please review my background at www.directpublicfunding.com

Currently out of retirement, I have helped a high-tech medical rehab company raise $30 million and bring an extraordinary new product to the market (see romtech.com for details). I am also the president of RomTech.

As a seasoned marketer, I saw the huge potential of using this same technology to develop a lower cost product with more customized features tailored for the consumer market.

As a spin off from RomTech, I founded OrthoGenesys and filed 6 patents on 2 revolutionary new consumer rehab/medical products. We have built prototypes and are currently working on manufacturing and a go-to-market strategy. 

For the right candidate, this is a long-term position with tremendous growth potential.  Compensation is competitive and is based on experience, accomplishments, and proven success.  

Qualified candidates, please respond and include:

- A cover letter detailing why you are the ideal fit for this job and your current pay requirements
- An up-to-date resume
- A few examples of products you have worked on

Finally, openness, honesty, and candidness are qualities we respond to—as opposed to framing things in the right way with the right words. Please be who you are and let the dice roll.
